# LUAD_Marker_Discovery
Discovering prognostic biomarkers for prediction of Lung Adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations. <br />
You can execute the code in this repository to reproduce the experimental results, figures and tables from the paper: <br />
<b> Robust prognostic biomarkers and a risk prediction model specific to EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma patients from integrative analysis of multicohort transcriptome data. </b>
The master code is <b>main.R</b> in the home repository. The source codes for patient, functional module data generation is deposited in <b>/data<b /> derectory, and the codes for generating figure in the paper is deposited in <b>/src</b> directory. <br>
